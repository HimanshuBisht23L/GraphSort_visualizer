# **Algorithm Visualizer** 

This project is a **React + Vite** based visualizer built for showcasing fundamental algorithms used in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA). It provides interactive, animated views of how different algorithms work step-by-step.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to help students and enthusiasts understand various algorithms visually and intuitively. Through a clean UI and dynamic animations, users can interact with sorting algorithms and graph traversals to observe their internal workings.
